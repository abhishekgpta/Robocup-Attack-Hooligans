> We have modified/implemented the following functions to get the structure of the strategy of our team while attack, defense or possession:-

	We modified the speed of the ball passing setting the favourable combinations out of combinations varying as per the velocity of the player and stamina/energy usage.

2. SamplePlayer::executeSampleRole():-

2. SamplePlayer::RoundToNearestHole():- 
	Helps in transforming the coordinates to the holes in the diamond shape.

3. SamplePlayer::RoundToNearestTens():- 
	Rounds up the x- or y- coordinates to the nearest tens values which we find helpful in dividing the ground into the small blocks of same size.

4. SamplePlayer::PassPlayersAvailable():-
	Checks for any of the player available in every sector around the player containing the ball, and if finds even a single player available in any of them, returns true.
